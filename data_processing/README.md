# Preparing Instructions and Image Features for Diagnose_VLN

This directory contains the scripts used for [generating ablated instructions](./process_instructions/README.md) and [generating image features](./Matterport3dsimulator/README.md) used in our study.

We include a copy of [Matterport3DSimulator](https://github.com/peteanderson80/Matterport3DSimulator) here for easier environment setup.
