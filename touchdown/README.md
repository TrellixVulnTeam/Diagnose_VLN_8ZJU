# Experiments on Touchdown

This directory contains the code and data for experiments on the [Touchdown](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Chen_TOUCHDOWN_Natural_Language_Navigation_and_Spatial_Reasoning_in_Visual_Street_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf) dataset for outdoor VLN.

We cover the following three models in our study:

- RCONCAT [[paper]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Chen_TOUCHDOWN_Natural_Language_Navigation_and_Spatial_Reasoning_in_Visual_Street_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf), [[code]](https://github.com/lil-lab/touchdown)
- ARC [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.13112.pdf)
- VLN-Transformer [[paper]](https://aclanthology.org/2021.eacl-main.103.pdf), [[code]](https://github.com/VegB/VLN-Transformer)

Please refer to [`data/`](./data/README.md) to prepare data for Touchdown abalations, and refer to the corresponding directories in `model/` for detailed instructions on environment setup and the commands to reproduce the results in our ablation studies.
