# Experiments on Room-across-room (RxR)

This directory contains the code and data for experiments on the [Room-across-room (RxR)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07954.pdf) dataset for indoor VLN.

We cover the following two models in our study:

- CLIP-ViL-VLN [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06383.pdf), [[code]](https://github.com/clip-vil/CLIP-ViL/tree/master/CLIP-ViL-VLN)
- VLN-HAMT [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13309.pdf), [[code]](https://github.com/cshizhe/VLN-HAMT)

Please refer to [`data/`](./data/README.md) to prepare the instructions and image features for RxR-en abalations, and refer to the corresponding directories in `model/` for detailed instructions on environment setup and the commands to reproduce the results in our ablation studies.
